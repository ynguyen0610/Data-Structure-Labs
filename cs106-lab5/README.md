### Analysis Questions

1. In Lab 3 we used insertion sort with Linked Lists to gradually build up
a sorted list of Students. If the total number of Students is n, what was the big-O runtime
of this algorithm? Briefly explain your answer.

2. In this assignment (Lab 5) we used insertion sort with a Binary Tree, then
used a tree traversal to obtain a sorted list of candidates. If the total
number of candidates is n, what is the big-O runtime of this algorithm? Briefly 
explain your answer.

### Pair programming log (will be graded)
You must fill the pair programming log. The format of the pair programming log can be downloaded [from here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18iMHmSW7zJMoVBThzoKmvNCzPIA93lAR/view?usp=sharing). You can fill it, then use Add File-> Upload file options on your the repo using web browser.
