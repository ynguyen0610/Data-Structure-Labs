Make sure you fill the log provided in **pair-programming folder** as accurately as possible. The log shall be graded. 

### Work on pre-lab

Pre-labs are to prepare you for the actual lab. Please take a look at pre-lab2-tasks.pdf in cs106-lab2/tasks/ to read the pre-lab2 tasks. 

### Work on the lab tasks
Tasks that you have to complete are listed in lab2_tasks.pdf provided in cs106-lab2/tasks/. Please spend time reading the tasks and planning how you would complete them with your partner before implementing them.  

### Reuse of what you have already completed
The tasks of this lab, build upon the tasks that you have completed in lab1. Please make reuse of the code that you have already written in lab1. 


### Lab resources are also available in the Google Drive folder shared with you, which has lectures and slides.
